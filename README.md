## Algorithm Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW)
### Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW) is a universal lossless data compression algorithm created by Abraham Lempel, Jacob Ziv, and Terry Welch. 
### It was published by Welch in 1984 as an improved implementation of the LZ78 algorithm published by Lempel and Ziv in 1978. 
### The algorithm is simple to implement and has the potential for very high throughput in hardware implementations. 
### It is the algorithm of the Unix file compression utility compress and is used in the GIF image format.
